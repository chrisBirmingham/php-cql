# PHP CQL

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

Native [Apache Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org) and
[ScyllaDB](https://www.scylladb.com) connector for PHP applications
using the CQL binary protocol (v4), without the need for an external
extension.

Requires [PHP](https://www.php.net/) version >=8, Cassandra >1.2,
and any ScyllaDB version.

Much of the API is built to emulate
the [Datastax PHP Driver](https://docs.datastax.com/en/developer/php-driver/1.3/index.html).

## Usage

### Cluster

A Cassandra cluster can be built via the `ClusterBuilder` class.
By default, the Cluster will try to connect to localhost.

```php
$clusterBuilder = new \CassandraNative\Cluster\ClusterBuilder();
$cassandra = $clusterBuilder->build();
```

You can specify a set of IP/hostnames to connect to using the
`withContactPoints` method.

The client will attempt to connect to one of the contact points 
at random. If the connection fails it will try another host until 
all contact points have been attempted. If the client cannot connect to 
any of the provided hosts a `NoHostsAvailableException` is thrown.

```php
$clusterBuilder = new \CassandraNative\Cluster\ClusterBuilder();
$clusterBuilder->withContactPoints(['1.0.0.0', '2.0.0.0']);
$cassandra = $clusterBuilder->build();
```

When connecting, the created Cassandra instance doesn't connect to
a specific keyspace. Calling `connect` on the created Cassandra
instance with a keyspace name will execute a `USE $keyspace` query.

```php
$cassandra->connect('system');
```

### SSL

You can turn on SSL Encryption via the `SSLBuilder` class and
pass the result of a call to the `build` method to the `withSSL`
method of a cluster builder instance.

```php
$sslBuilder = new \CassandraNative\SSL\SSLBuilder();
$sslBuilder
    ->withClientCert(__DIR__ . '/certs/localhost.cer')
    ->withPrivateKey(__DIR__ . '/certs/localhost.key.pem');
    ->withTrustedCerts(__DIR__ . '/certs/localhost.cer.pem');

$clusterBuilder->withSSL($sslBuilder->build());
```

### Compression

Compression can be enabled by calling the `withCompression` method
on the cluster builder.

```php
$clusterBuilder->withCompression(true);
```

The client will check to see if either the snappy or LZ4 extensions
are installed and picks the one that is available. If both are
available it will pick LZ4 over Snappy. If neither are available
the builder will throw an exception when you try to build the
cluster.

### Authentication

Authentication can be enabled by providing an Authentication Provider 
to the cluster build via the `withCredentials` method. With this library
is the `PasswordAuthenticator` provider which accepts a plaintext username 
and password.

```php
$authProvider = new \CassandraNative\Auth\PasswordAuthenticator('cassandra', 'cassandra');
$clusterBuilder->withCredentials($authProvider);
```

For other SASL based authentication methods you'll need to provide/use your 
own implementation. This can be done by creating a class which implements the 
`AuthProviderInterface`.

```php
<?php 

class KeberosProvider implements \CassandraNative\Auth\AuthProviderInterface
{
    public function mechanism(): string
    {
        return 'java class name';
    }    

    public function response(): string
    {
        return 'i am an initial response';
    }
}
```

The `mechanism` method returns the fully qualified name of the java class 
cassandra is configured to use. This name can be found in the `authenticator.class_name` 
directive of the cassandra.yaml config.

The `response` method is called when the first auth challenge is issued. Some 
auth providers will only require sending this response.

For auth providers that require responding to subsequent authentication challenges 
the `AuthChallengeProvderInterface` is provided. This interface provides the `challengeResponse` 
method. This method accepts an `token` parameter which contains the binary representation 
of a token sent back from the Cassandra node describing how to respond to the auth
challenge. 

If a provider does not implement the `AuthChallengeProviderInterface` and an auth
challenge is issued after the first response, an `AuthenticationException` is thrown.

### Statements

The client currently only supports two types of statements, `Simple`
and `Prepared`. Both types of statement are executed via the `execute` method
on the `Cassandra` instance. The execute method accepts the statement, an optional
array of values to bind to parameters and an optional consistency level which
overrides the default consistency.

The `execute` method returns a `Rows` class which implements the `ArrayAccess` and
`Iterator` interfaces.

#### Simple Statements

Simple statements use the `SimpleStatement` class.

```php
$stmt = new \CassandraNative\Statement\SimpleStatement('DESCRIBE TABLES');
$rows = $cassandra->execute($stmt);
```

Simple statements support parameterised values.

```php
$stmt = new \CassandraNative\Statement\SimpleStatement('SELECT col1, col2, col3 FROM my_table WHERE id=?')
$rows = $cassandra->execute(
    $stmt,
    [
        [1001, Cassandra::COLUMNTYPE_BIGINT]
    ]
);

// Or

$stmt = new \CassandraNative\Statement\SimpleStatement('SELECT col1, col2, col3 FROM my_table WHERE id=:id')
$rows = $cassandra->execute(
    $stmt,
    [
        'id' => [1001, Cassandra::COLUMNTYPE_BIGINT]
    ]
);
```

You must specify the bound parameters type when using a simple statement

#### Prepared Statements

Prepared Statements are created via the `prepare` method on the `Cassandra` instance.

```php
$stmt = $cassandra->prepare('UPDATE my_table SET col2=?,col3=? WHERE col1=?');
$values = ['col2' => 5, 'col3' => '0x55', 'col1' => 'five'];
$rows = $cassandra->execute($stmt, $values);
```

Unlike Simple Statements, you don't need to specify the bound values type.
